1. What is the collection framework?

	->Collection => A collection is an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit.
		example - collection of books.
	
	->Collection Framework => The collection framework is a unified achitecture for representing and manipulating collections.
	
	-> Collection framework contains the following stuff:
		1. Interfaces
		2. Implementations
		3. Algorithm


2. Benefits Of Using Collection Framework?

	-> Reduces programming effort.
	-> Increases program speed and quality.
	-> Reduces effprt for code maintenence.
	-> Reusability and inheritance. 


3. Collection Interfaces and Classes?

	-> The collections framework defines several interfaces.
	-> The collection interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of their representations.
	-> Java provides a set of standard collection classes that implement the collection interfaces.
	-> Some have full implementations and others are abstract classes.
	-> AbstractList, ArrayList, LinkedList.
	-> AbsractSet, HashSet, TreeSet.
	-> AbstractMap, HashMap, LinkedHashMap
	-> Stack, Queue, etc 
	
	==>> Full Implementations set?
		-> ArrayList, LinkedList.
		-> HashSet, TreeSet
		-> HashMap, LinkedHashMap
		-> Stack, Queue, etc 
	==>> Abstract Classes set?
		-> AbstractList
		-> AbstractMap
		-> AbstractSet

4. Important Note for Map
	-> HaspMap does not guarantee ordering of elements.
	-> TreeMap orders elements according to the ascending order of the key.
	-> LinkedListMap maintains the elements insertions order.
